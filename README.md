Thoughts:
The Odin Project has really helped me excel and clearly understand the basics of coding
Even though I'm a beginner the website teaches me new skills and ideas of lessons.
The Odin Project also provides sources for learners to really dig deep and look for more informations.
I've been learning HTML for the past few weeks, and finished my first project with the website's instructions.
I'm looking forward to learn more about coding with the help of The Odin Project.
